## My process

I started with HTML, initially adding plain text, and then proceeded to include tags with the correct semantics before styling block by block. I avoided the use of divs and had to get creative with <hr/> in the tables. I wasn't sure about the colored background, so I decided to implement it in one of the resolutions to keep the content centered and stylish.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project, I learned to use 'text-indent' for the table and had the opportunity to practice using tags that I had forgotten how to use.
